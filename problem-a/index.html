    <p>
        Remy is a character I admire very much. He is from the animated movie,
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)">Ratatouille</a></cite>,
        directed by Brad Bird in 2007. I admire his strength and determination,
        as he follows his dreams in becoming a chef. His reslience in the face
        of challenges encourages the audience to pursue one's passion(s).
